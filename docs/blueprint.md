## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft blue (#A0D2EB) to evoke a sense of calmness and trust, reflecting the helpful nature of the app.
- Background color: Very light blue (#F0F8FF), close in hue to the primary color, to keep the interface bright and clean, almost white.
- Accent color: Light purple (#B583A3), an analogous color to blue, for CTAs and highlights, contrasting enough for visibility without being jarring.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif that combines a modern look and a little warmth or personality.
- Use simple, outlined icons for categories and actions.
- Clean and intuitive layout with a focus on easy navigation and readability.
